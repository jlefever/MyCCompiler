How many qualifiers and storage types can a variable (or function) have?

Can `restrict` be applied to anything or just pointers?

Tackle types in this order:
    1. Primitives (basic data types)
    2. Pointers to primitives and pointers
    3. Functions with return type and parameter types
    4. Pointers to functions
    5. Structs and Unions
    6. Arrays
