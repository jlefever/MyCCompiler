# MyCCompiler

MyCCompiler is a multi-pass compiler targeting x86 assembly for a “reasonable” subset of the C programming language. MyCCompiler is written in C#/.NET. The subset of C acting as the source language includes common constructs such as integer declarations, integer arithmetic (including addition, multiplication, division, etc), string literals, decision statements, loops, pointers, function definitions, and function calls. Additionally, MyCCompiler implements the standard x86 C calling convention (cdecl) so with the help of an assembler and linker, MyCCompiler can generate code that interops with the C standard library. Notable things missing from MyCCompiler include function pointers, floating point types, record types, array types, and any type that is not a 32-bit integer.
